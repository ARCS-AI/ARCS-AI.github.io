## code 1 : GPIO 

Inside while(1) loop of main function:

```sh
  while (1)
  {
    /* USER CODE END WHILE */
	  HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_5);
	  HAL_Delay(1000);

    /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */
  }
  ```

  pin PA5 in pin configuration set to GPIO_output.

  LD2 blinks on the stm32f303re board.



##  Code 2 : USART 

  USART2 `Asynchronous mode` generate code
  - PA2 --> USART2_TX 
  - PA3 --> USART2_RX

  - PA5 --> GPIO_output

  I2C 
  - PB9 --> I2C1_SDA
  - PB8 --> I2C1_SCL

  Initialize an unsigned integer (uint8_t) buf[12] as shown below for Hal functions with 12 as a big enough number for our array buffer (buf) for now.

  ```c++
  int main(void)
{
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 1 */
	uint8_t buf[12];
  /* USER CODE END 1 */

  /* MCU Configuration--------------------------------------------------------*/

  /* Reset of all peripherals, Initializes the Flash interface and the Systick. */
  HAL_Init();
 ```

 Inside the while(1) loop of the main function:

 ```sh
strcpy((char*)buf, "Hello!\r\n");
HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart2, buf, strlen((char*)buf), HAL_MAX_DEALY);
HAL_Delay(500);
```
 And include "string.h" library at the very top.
 > #include "string.h"

 Now build program. Then Run --> Debug as --> stm32 application.
 Connect the stm32f303re board to tha laptop. 
 Note: that ST-link is connected to the USB, hence could be used as a virtual COM Port as seen in the `device manager` below:

 Now open the windows terminal and connect to **COM3** with baudrate 38400. 
 (Baudrate is set in the code program.)

 The output on the terminal is shown below:

## **code 3 : I2C**


### How to Use I2C to Read Temperature Sensor TMP102

- Inter-Integrated Chip (IIC or I2C) protocol is a 2-wire bus that contains a clock and data channel. The master (microcontroller/ Raspberry Pi) and device (sensor) can communicate on the same data wire.


- Unlike SPI, I2C relies on a set of addresses and registers. This is because SPI is configured to talk to one chip at a time while I2C can share many devices on one bus. To avoid conflicts, addresses are assigned to devices (by the manufacturer) so that each one knows when the host (the Pi) is trying to talk to it. The address for our TMP102 is 0x48.

Each time we want to talk to the TMP102, we must send out its address (0x48) on the bus. Only then can we send the memory location (or address) of the register that we want to read from or write to on the TMP102. Note that for most I2C devices, a register is a location in the device's memory that stores 8 bits (1 byte) of data. Sometimes, this data controls the function of the device (as in the case of the CONFIG register). Other times, the registers hold the sensor reading data (as in the case of the temperature register).

To see this protocol in action, we'll write a program to talk to a TMP102 Temperature Sensor.

We use the following command to read 2 bytes from the temperature register in the TMP102.

- The `temperature resolution` (13 bits or 12 bits or 11 bits, etc) depends on the specific temperature sensor. You have to find the temperature resolution of that specific temperature sensor so that you can read the termperature data recived from the sensor properly by understanding how many bits of data you have take into consideration to read the temperature in degree Celsius.
 - If the temperature resolution is 13 bits (from [datasheet](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/SE95.pdf)) as in the case of the `SE 95` temperature sensor, then consider only 13 bits from left to right to interpret the sensor reading.
 - Whereas, if the temperature resolution is 12 bits (from [datasheet](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Temperature/tmp102.pdf?_ga=2.267576782.130767395.1623259448-31973257.1623259448) as shown below) as in the case of the `TMP 102` temperature sensor, then consider only 12 bits to interpret the sensor reading.

## To read 2 bytes from the temperature register in the SE 95 with 13 bit temperature resolution:


![image](\Images\stm32\SE_95.PNG)

From  the above diagram, 
- `write mode` uses `0` bit  [before restart write mode]
- `read mode` uses `1` bit  [after restart read mode]
- First, `write` operation happens then `read` operation. 
- the Data is transferred in 9 (bits) SCL clock pulses signal:  
`9 bits SCL clk pulses signal = (address 7 bits) + 1 bit (read/write bit) + 1 bit (acknowledgement bit)`
- The acknowledgement bit is `0`' to indicate working properly.
- Whereas,  non-acknoledgement bit is `1`.

## Calculations to derive the temperature value in degree Celcius from the above diagram:
- We see that: `Write[150] + ACK`
  This means: 9 bits = Write[150] + ACK 
  And Write[150] means 8 bits (1 byte) which is inclusive of address of the temperature register plus write mode one bit which is `0` bit.

```
`Write[150] + ACK`
```
  Here, 150 is the decimal value.
  -  150<sub>decimal</sub> = 0x96 <sub>HEX</sub>          ... ( decimal to hex)
  -  And, (96)<sub>HEX</sub> = (10010110)<sub>2</sub>      ... ( hex to 8-bit binary)

  -  1001 0110 --> 8 bits out of which last bit is `write bit` (0 bit).

  So the first 7 bits (1001 011) form the address of the temperature register.

  -  1001011<sub>2</sub>--> 4B<sub>HEX</sub>  ---> `7 bit address of the temperature register`


==================================================
```
- We see that: `Read[151] + ACK`

```
 -  151<sub>decimal</sub> = 0x97 <sub>HEX</sub>

 -  (97)<sub>HEX</sub> = 1001011<sub>2</sub>  ---> 8th bit `read` bit (`1` bit )

 - 100101<sub>2</sub>--> 4B<sub>HEX</sub>  ---> `7 bit address of the temperature register`  same value as during write mode


===============================================

```
- To read `2 bytes` from the `temperature register` in the `SE 95 temperature sensor`.
1st byte of the sensor reading gives the decimal number before the integer point.
```
-  Here, (0001 0100)<sub>2</sub> = 20<sub>decimal</sub>

2nd byte of the senosr readin gives the numbers after the integer point. But, we have to consider only 13 bits including both 1st and 2nd byte to get the teperature sensor reading (for temperature resolution for SE95 temperature sensor is 13 bits ). So do not consider the last 3 bits from the 2nd byte. 
- 1011 0000  -->  1011 0<del>000</del>  --> 10110 
- **`10110`** this is the value we want after chopping off the last 3 bits from 2nd byte.

- Here, (10110)<sub>2</sub> = 22<sub>decimal</sub>

 Note: (1011 0000)<sub>2</sub> = 176<sub>decimal</sub>  --> (be careful to not consider this value)




So, together 2 bytes of data to form the temperature sensore reading is:

```
>           (1st byte) | (2nd byte minus last 3 bits)
>          0001 0100   | 1011 0
>                  20  .  (22 x 0.03125)      
>                  20  . 6895                 ......... (22 x 0.03125 = 0.6895)
>                  20.6895 degree Celsius

```
- Therefore, the temperature sensor reading is **`20.6895 degree Celsius`**.


- **Note** : The value `0.03125` comes from the datasheet which is same for different temperature sensors with 13 bit temperature resolution. If its a 12 bit temperature resolution temperature sensor like `TMP 102` then use the value `0.0625` as given in the table below.

## Positive and negative temperatures

Refer to Table 11 above.
```
  Positive temperature

```
   - ( 000 1100 1000)<sub>2</sub> --> this is the 11 bit temperature resolution sensor
   - Since MSB = 0 (Most left bit is 0), therefore this temperature is positve temperature.
      - (000  1100  1000)<sub>2</sub> = (0 C 8)<sub>Hex</sub>
      - (0C8)<sub>Hex</sub> = 200<sub>10</sub>
      - Thus, decimal value of the temperature data is 200. But we are not done yet. We still have to calculate its value in Degree Celsius. 
      - Now, refer to Table 10 above, For `11-bit temperature data resolution`, 0.125 degree Celsius is the `value resolution`. Therefore, 200 multiply by 0.125 <sup>o</sup>C
      - 200 x 0.125 = 25.0 <sup>o</sup>C
      - 
     
      Thus, the temperature sensor reading for termperature sensot with 11-bit temperature data resolution ( 000 1100 1000)  is **`25 degrees Celsius`**.

```   
   Negative temperature

```
   - (111 0011 1000)<sub>2</sub> --> this is the 11 bit temperature resolution sensor
   - Since MSB = 1 (Most left bit is 1), therefore this temperature is **negative temperature**.
   - Therefore, implement 2's complement by inverting all the bits and adding 1 to (111 0011 1000)<sub>2</sub>.
      - inverting all the bits of **(111 0011 1000)**<sub>2</sub> we get **(000 1100 0111)**<sub>2</sub>.
      - Adding 1 to inverted bits **(000 1100 0111)<sub>2</sub>** we get (000 1100 1000)<sub>2</sub>.
    - Now, convert this 2's complement to hexadecimal form: (000 1100 1000)<sub>2</sub> = (0 3 8 )<sub>16</sub>
    -  (0 3 8 )<sub>16</sub> = (200)<sub>10</sub>
    - But, since this is a negative temperature, the temperature data resolution value is -200.
    - Now, refer to Table 10 above, For `11-bit temperature data resolution`, 0.125 degree Celsius is the `value resolution`. Therefore, 200 multiply by 0.125 <sup>o</sup>C
      -  (-200) x 0.125 = -25.0 <sup>o</sup>C 
    
      Thus, the temperature sensor reading for termperature sensot with 11-bit temperature data resolution (111 0011 1000)  is **`-25 degrees Celsius`**.
