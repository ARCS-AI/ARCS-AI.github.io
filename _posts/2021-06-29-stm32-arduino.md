Nucleo boards are the highly affordable and powerful boards from the ST Microelectronics. STM32 Nucleo boards allow anyone to try out new ideas and to quickly create prototypes with any STM32 MCU.

However, Arduino is unbeatable in this segment due its simplicity and ease of its IDE. The performance to the cost ration of the Arduino boards is very low, which make some hobbyists to look into other boards. STM has bought up the Nucleo development boards, whose performance to the cost ratio is pretty high as compared to that of Arduino.

Thanks to "STM32 Core" (Official) team for porting some of their popular Nucleo boards into Arduino IDE and helping all the Arduino users happy to the core.

##  Step 1 : Setup for stm32 board in arduino IDE

Firstly open the Arduino IDE

Go to `files` and click on the `preference` in the `Arduino IDE`

Enter the following:

```sh
https://github.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/raw/master/package_stmicroelectronics_index.json

```
in the `Additional Boards Manager URLs`.

And Click `Ok` toclose the `preference tab`.

## Step 2 : Installing the Package

 Now Click on `Tools`, click on `Board` a drop-down menu will be popped. Click on `Boards Manager`. This opens the Boards Manager, scroll down and navigate to the `STM32 MCU based boards` package by ST-Microelectronics and install it.

And that's it, you've done with installing the `Nucleo board packages` into the `Arduino IDE`.


## Step 3: Connect Stm32 board to Arduino IDE

Select `tools` -> `board: Nuleo-64` -> `board part number: NULCEO F303RE` -> `Port: COM3`

Connect the stm32f303RE board to laptop.

And write the following code in new sketch.

```c

#ifndef LED_BUILTIN
  #define LED_BUILTIN PC13
#endif

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
    pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  // wait for a second
  delay(500);                 // test by making this delay = 1000
  // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
   // wait for a second
  delay(250);
}
```
