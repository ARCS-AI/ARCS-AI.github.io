NLP is awesome.

## Beginning of GSoC 2022!

I recently came to know the Googleâ€™s Summer of Code program which runs in summer. I loved the idea of contributing to the open source community I wanted to apply, but it was too late to apply for 2021. So, I intended to apply for Summer 2022. 

## Motivation
I stumbled upon INCF project and it immediately struck a cord with me. Deep learning is an exciting journey especially with Hugging Face Transformers.
